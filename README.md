Espruino Module Catalog
=======================

Collection of modules for [Espruino platform](http://espruino.com).

You don't have to install anything. Just point Module URL in Settings →
Communications of your Espruino Web IDE to http://nickprogramm.github.io/espruino-modcat/modules.
It acts as a proxy with a fallback to espruino.com for modules not found
here.

Alternatively you can put some modules you're interested in into `modules`
subdirectory of your project sandbox.
